# Romance-Poem-Generator

This is a my final project for FullStacks: Phase 1

Project Name: Romance.js

This project is to generate a poem.
1. It trains itself to write poetry using a Markov Chain
2. Generate complete poems based on a word corpus (no-fill-in-the-blanks)



I really enjoyed and using the fundamentals of JavaScript that I have learned throughout this course
and implement objects. 

I still have a lot to learn and improve on and I would like to come back to this project and implement DOM with 
HTML and CSS to create a web app.
